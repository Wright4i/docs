It's very easy to work with the vscode-ibmi extension.

### Developing and debugging

1. clone repo
2. `npm i`
3. 'Run extension' from VS Code debug.

### Creating a `.vsix`

To build a .`vsix` of the extension, you can use:

```bash title="terminal"
npm run package
```

### Run test cases

To run the tests, start debugging the **Extension Tests** configuration and connect to a system for the tests to run.

After the Extension Host is launched, connect to a system - this system is where the test runs. The tests should not alter any system configuration or existing files.

After you've connected, the tests will launch automatically. You can see which tests are being executed in the Test Cases view.

If a test fails, you can see the result by hovering over the failed test.
